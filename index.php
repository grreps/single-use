        <h1>Single use download</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Brief</h2><br>
        <p>This script was written to be a very easy way for non-programmers to be able to create a secure way to share a single file. It is ideal for 
        bands looking to give a single song to a single person, and invalidating the link once the song has been downloaded. However, 
        it will work for any type of file.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Description</h2><br>
        <p>This script allows you to generate a unique link to download a file. This file will only be allowed to be downloaded one time. 
        This link will also have also have an expiration date set on it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For instance, if you wanted to sell a song for your band. You sold the song on your website for $1, you could use this script 
        to allow that person to download your song only one time. It would only give them a limited number of hours/days/weeks/years 
        to claim their download.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can also mask the name of the file being downloaded, for further protection. For example, if your song was called 
        "greatsong.zip", you could set the download link as "Band_Awesome-Awesome_Song.zip" (it is not a good idea to leave spaces in URL titles)</p>
        <h2>Update</h2><br>
        <p>On July 11, 2016 a multi-file feature branch was merged with the single file. It is now possible to download multiple files at once. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Example</h2><br>
        <p>Click to generate new download links for local and/or remote files declared in variables.php.</p>
      	<p>Currently, variables.php declares two demo local files in ./secret folder plus an example dropbox folder.</p>
        <p>Generating new links does not affect any previously-generated unexpired links.</p>
        <p>
        <a href="/single-use/view.php?<?php echo ADMIN_PASSWORD; ?>"><button>ðŸ“œ View existing links</button></a>
        <a href="/single-use/generate.php?<?php echo ADMIN_PASSWORD; ?>"><button>âš¡ Generate new links</button></a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>To maximize security of secret files:
          <ul>
            <li>Password-protect your secret files by putting them in zip files with at least 256-bit AES encryption</li>
            <li>Give the recipient the password(s) only after he/she confirms he/she has the files</li>
            <li>Give the passwords over a communication channel different from the one you use to send download links</li>
            <li>Delete the copies of secret files from your web server once the recipient has confirmed he/she can open them</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
